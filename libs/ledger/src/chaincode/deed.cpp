 * Below is expected deed JSON structure for CREATION of deed on provided
 * address, or AMENDing the deed currently existing on the provided address.
 * All 3 root elements `address`, `signees` and `thresholds` are MANDATORY,
 * `signees` MUST contain at LEAST one signee, and `thresholds` must contain
 * at LEAST one threshold. Where only known & handled thresholds are "transfer"
 * and "amend". The "amend" threshold is utilized for amending (what includes
 * DELETION) of the pre-existing deed.
 * PLEASE BE MINDFUL, that even if permitted, omission of the "amend" threshold
 * has severe consequences - forever DISABLING possibility to amend the deed!
 * {
 *   "address": "BASE64_ENCODED_DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
 *   "signees" : {
 *     "BASE64_ENCODED_ADDRESS_0" : VOTING_WEIGHT_0 as UNSIGNED_INT,
 *     "BASE64_ENCODED_ADDRESS_1" : VOTING_WEIGHT_1 as UNSIGNED_INT,
 *     ...,
 *     "BASE64_ENCODED_ADDRESS_N" : VOTING_WEIGHT_N as UNSIGNED_INT
 *     },
 *   "thresholds" : {
 *     "transfer" : UNSIGNED_INT,
 *     "amend" : UNSIGNED_INT
 *     }
 * }
 * @example Example:
 * {
 *   "address" : "OTc3NTY1MzAwMTMyMzQzMzM2Ng==",
 *   "signees" : {
 *     "NTAzOTA1MzM4NDM3OTM3MzI5Ng==" : 1,
 *     "OTc3NTY1MzAwMTMyMzQzMzM2Ng==" : 2,
 *     "ODc4MDQ4NDMxNDM1MzY4NDgwNg==" : 3
 *     },
 *   "thresholds" : {
 *     "transfer" : 4,
 *     "amend" : 6
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Below is expected deed JSON structure for DELETION of the deed currently
 * existing on the provided address.
 * Both `signees` AND `thresholds` elements must NOT be present to clearly
 * indicate intention to DELETE the pre-existing deed - if any of these elements
 * are present, amend procedure will fail and so pre-existing deed will remain
 * in effect:
 * {
 *   "address": "BASE64_ENCODED_DESTINATION_ADDRESS"
 * }
 * @example
 * {
 *   "address": "MTM1NTgwMTI1ODkwMzQzNDMyODQ="
 * }
