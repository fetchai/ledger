Configure git<a name="git_configuration"/>
==========================================
It is necessary to configure your local git setup based on [this guide](https://github.com/uvue-git/docker-images/blob/master/README_git_setup.md), otherwise pulling the submodules might not work.


Docker - build, develop & run stuff in docker container<a name="docker"/>
=========================================================================
This project has full support for Docker - it is dedicated to be used for building whole project, execute resulting binaries and do whole development using docker, please see details in [this guide](https://github.com/uvue-git/docker-images/blob/master/README.md#guick_usage_guide).

Initiate
========
git submodule update --recursive --remote

Build
=====

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


On Ubuntu
=========

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev cmake
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev

NOTE: the whole necessary setup is defined by the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/uvue-git/docker-images/blob/master/fetch-ledger-develop-image/Dockerfile), also checkout the [Docker](#docker) section bellow for more details about our docker setup.


Test
====

ctest

Notes
=====
If network gives random read/write errors, it can be an indication that
not enough threads are available. Long term we need to have a logging
mechanism for when this happens to ensure we can meet demand.
