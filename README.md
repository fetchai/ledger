* Ubuntu 18.04 (x86_64)

(We plan to support all major platforms in the future)

## Getting Started

A more complete guide is available in our [Getting Started Guide](docs/source/getting_started/index.rst).
However, the following section outlines some of the initial steps.

To get started, ensure all the code along with the submodules has been checked out with the
following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/fetchai/ledger.git

    cd ledger

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Dependencies

### Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev cmake python3-dev clang

### MacOS

    sudo brew install cmake openssl

## Building the code

The project uses cmake so you can following formal build procedure of:

    mkdir build

    cd build

    cmake ../

    make -j

## Connecting to a test network

Connecting and joining the test net is relatively straight forward. This first thing to do is to
ensure that you have build the latest version of the `constellation` application.

    cd build

    cmake ../

    make -j constellation

Navigate to the constellation application folder:

    cd apps/constellation

Optionally delete the database files (in the case where you have been running a local network)

    rm -f *.db

Start the network connecting to the `alpha` test network.

    ./constellation -bootstrap -network alpha
