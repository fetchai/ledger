Docker - build, develop & run stuff in docker container<a name="docker"></a>
=======================================================
This project has full support for Docker - it is dedicated to be used for building whole project, execute resulting binaries and do whole development using docker, please see details in [this guide](uvue-git/docker-images/README.md#guick_usage_guide).

Notes
=====
If network gives random read/write errors, it can be an indication that
not enough threads are available. Long term we need to have a logging
mechanism for when this happens to ensure we can meet demand.
