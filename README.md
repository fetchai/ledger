## Roadmap

This project is currently Experimental. As we integrate all of our features into the codebase we expect to make wide ranging changes.

The following list outlines the short term milestones for the ledger project:

#### Milestone 1: Scalable ledger demonstrator (current)

  * Scalable ledger concept

#### Milestone 2: P2P Karma improvements

  * Improved P2P infrastructure
  * Improved Karma (Trust) modelling of peers

#### Milestone 3: Virtual Machine

  * Integrate our smart contract engine and the language virtual machine

#### Milestone 4: uPOW integration

  * Integration of useful proof of work consensus algorithm

## Supported platforms

* MacOS Darwin 10.13x and higher (64bit)
* Ubuntu 18.04 (x86_64)

(We plan to support all major platforms in the future)

## Getting Started

Instructions on building and testing the code based are detailed in the [Getting Started Docs](docs/source/getting_started/index.rst)
