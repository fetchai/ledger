Configure git<a name="git_configuration"/>
==========================================
It is necessary to configure your local git setup based on [this guide](https://github.com/uvue-git/docker-images/blob/master/README_git_setup.md),
otherwise pulling the submodules might not work.
Once you have modified your .gitconfig you should be able to do

    git pullall

to get all the submodules required for the project.

Docker - build, develop & run stuff in docker container<a name="docker"/>
=========================================================================
This project has full support for Docker - it is dedicated to be used for building whole project, execute resulting binaries and do whole development using docker, please see details in [this guide](https://github.com/uvue-git/docker-images/blob/master/README.md#guick_usage_guide).

In short, it should be easy to use the docker environment, like so:

# Build docker (optional)
    sudo develop-image/scripts/docker-build-img.sh

# Run docker
    sudo develop-image/scripts/docker-run.sh bash

Initiate
========
    git pull
    git pullall

Running on Ubuntu
=========
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev cmake
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    sudo apt-get install clang

Build
=====

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j8

Coverage quick start guide
=====

### although it's possible to do this natively, we recommend using a docker image for compatability guarantees
    sudo ./develop-image/scripts/docker-run.sh bash
    mkdir coverage_build
    cd coverage_build

### Configure build in cmake (adds coverage flags)
    ccmake .
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - set this to Debug
* FETCH_ENABLE_COVERAGE - set this to ON
* 'c' to configure
* 'g' to generate
* 'q' to quit

### build the library
    make -j

### generate the coverage for the part of the library you care about
    cd ../
    ./scripts/generate_coverage.py --help
    ./scripts/generate_coverage.py ./coverage_build/{part_of_lib}

### Coverage should now be in that part of the libaray (e.g. coverage_build/{part_of_lib}/coverage/...
    ls coverage_build/{part_of_lib}/coverage

### view the coverage reports in a browser outside of docker
    {brower_name} ./coverage_build/{part_of_lib}/coverage
### navigate to all_coverage/index.html to get started

Test
====

    cd build
    ctest

Notes
=====

If the changes in the PR do not adhere to Fetch's coding style, the CI will automatically reject it.

To automatically apply trivial stylistic fixes, run (best done in docker due to requiring modern clang tools, clang-format):

    ./scripts/apply-style.py

To automatically run static analysis to check for and fix coding style violations, run (best done in docker due to requiring modern clang tools, clang-tidy):

    ./scripts/run-static-analysis.py ./build --fix

Note: this takes a long time, and running with the fix flag may cause clang to break the code (changing
variable names without propagating their updates). Therefore it is recommended you have a clean HEAD so as
to identify the changes that have been made. Build the project again before pushing it as it's likely
to be broken
