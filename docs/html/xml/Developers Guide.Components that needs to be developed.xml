  <brief>A short description of what we need to develop.</brief>
  <doc># MVP Friday the 26th

Would require:
1. Transaction definition                                  (write tonight)
2. STL vector for unapplied transactions
3. Networking inteface to deliver transactions / recieve
4. Block definition
5. Block queue
6. Blockchain definition                                   (write tonight)
7. Proof-of-work implemenation

Block and transaction definition could fall into same category

# Low level functionality

## VariantStack (done)
This implementation is done and can be found in the source.

## RandomAccessStack (done)
This implementation is done and can be found in the source.

## VersionedRandomAccessStack (done)
This implementation is done and can be found in the source.

## FileObject (in progress)



## Indexed Document Storage (not started)
Given an integer, this object allows you to read and write documents of
the hard drive.  This data types exists in two variants:  

1. Indexed Document Storage
2. Indexed Versioned Document Storage 

The implementation relies on FileObject to do the read and write.


## Hash Modifier (not started)

This is function that is supplied as argument to some of the following
data structures. It's main purpose is to define how we

All of the previous

## Named Document Store /  Named Versioned Document Store /  Hashed Named Document Store /  Hashed Named Versioned Document Store

This is an unversioned document store that
