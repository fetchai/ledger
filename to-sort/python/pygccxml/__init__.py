"""Python GCC-XML front end.

This package provides functionality to extract and inspect
declarations from C/C++ header files. This is accomplished
by invoking the external tool U{gccxml<http://www.gccxml.org/>}
which parses a header file and dumps the declarations as a
XML file. This XML file is then read by pygccxml and the contents
are made available as appropriate Python objects.

To parse a set of C/C++ header files you use the
L{parse()<parser.parse>} function in the L{parser} sub package which
returns a tree that contains all declarations found in the header
files. The root of the tree represents the main namespace C{::} and
the children nodes represent the namespace contents such as other
namespaces, classes, functions, etc. Each node in the tree is an
object of a type derived from the
L{declaration_t<declarations.declaration_t>} base class. An inner
node is always either a namespace (L{namespace_t<declarations.namespace_t>})
or a class (L{class_t<declarations.class_t>}) which are both derived
from L{scopedef_t<declarations.scopedef_t>}. Everything else (free functions,
member functions, enumerations, variables, etc.) is always a leaf.
You will find all those declaration classes in the L{declarations}
sub-package.
