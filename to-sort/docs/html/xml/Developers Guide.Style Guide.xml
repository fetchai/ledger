  <brief>A guide that describes the style of our code.</brief>
  <doc># C++ style guide.
*This is an initial rewrite of what's on the wiki - to be revised!.*

## Summary
To make it nice and simple to get started we here make a brief summary
of the style guide. Some of the choices in this guide may be "arbitrary"
but should be followed nonetheless as the purpose of a style guide is to
make the code look and feel like it was written by a single skilled
programmer.

### Formatting
Use spaces, not tabs. Make indenting

To assist you formatting your code, you can make use of the
`apply_style` script provided.

### General sanity
1. First and formost, use STL types whenever you can. If not appropriate,
**always** check error codes and return codes. Great amounts of example
code omit error checking to keep things simple. More security and
stability errors occur due to piss-poor error checking than many other
things. Do **not** rely on exceptions to avoid having to take any
responsibility.

2. Do not assume, do `assert`. Adding `asset` whenever you can while
make your debugging code a bit slower, but will have no impact on your
release code.

3. Do not assume, write tests. Your code may work when you commit it to
the repository, but when you later on decide to integrate it into other
parts of the system or refactor, the changes you make may break your
code. If you have a proper test suite in place, this will not go
unnoticed.

4. Always be const correct. If it is const, declare it as such. E.g., if
you have a member function that does not modify member variables,
returns a constant value and takes one constant parameter, *get it
right*: 

5. Comment the non-obvious, not the obvious, is how I'd phrase the
commenting one. 

6. Prefer `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` over raw pointers. Use
references where the value cannot be null, use pointers where it
can. Always prefer passing by const reference or reference where
possible.

7. Don't use `#define`. And if you decide to do this anyway, then chose a
`FETCH_STARTING_REALLY_LONG_NAME_THAT_CANNOT_POSSIBLY_CLASH_WITH_ANYTHING_ELSE`
and undefine it as soon as you are one with it.

8. Use `static_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, `dynamic_cast` etc. rather
than C-style casts, as this is explicit and easy to understand.

9. Any warning is an error. A code committed to the repository should be
pruned for warnings as these are errors occuring at runtime and actually
not warnings. Compile with `-Wall -Werror`.

10. Lines should be no longer than 80 characters. `apply_style` can fix
this for you.

### Naming
Use meaningful names.

For stucts, member variables are named with all lower case using
underscore to separate words, or mixed case using upper case to separate
words. For instance, "first_name" or "firstName" are valid variable
member names for structs.

For classes, we follow the convention 

### Commenting and documenting
Code can and should be documented, both inline and on an API. An
important part of documenting is chosing good names but also to make
comments where appropriate. All comments must use a professional
language. The source code is no place for jokes or expletives in
comments. Don't

```
  // Computes exponential using magic
  double Exp(double const &amp;x) {
    // No idea where these magic constants come from
    static double const a = double(1ull &lt;&lt; 20) / M_LN2;
    static double const b = ((1ull &lt;&lt; (10)) - 1) * double(1ull &lt;&lt; 20); - 60801;
    double in = x * a + b;

    union { // How the f$#k does this work?
      double d;
      uint32_t i[2];
    } conv;

    conv.i[1] = static_cast&lt;uint32_t&gt;(in);
    conv.i[0] = 0;

    return conv.d;
  }
```

Do

```
  /* Approximation of the exponential function.
   * @x is the argument that is used in the exponent 2^(x / M_LN2).
   *
   * We exploit the IEEE-754 standard to effeciently create a linear
   * interpolation between points of the form 2^n where n is an integer.
   *
   * You can find the full details in
   * [1] "A fast, compact appraoximation of the exponential function",
   * Nicol N. Schraudolph, 1999 Neural computation 11, 853-862.
   *
   * @return the exponential of x.
   */
  double Exp(double const &amp;x) {
    // We use the constants explained in [1] and additional make e the
    // base rather than using 2.
    static double const a = double(1ull &lt;&lt; 20) / M_LN2;
    static double const b = ((1ull &lt;&lt; (10)) - 1) * double(1ull &lt;&lt; 20); - 60801;
    double in = x * a + b;

    // Move the computed bits into the exponent with spilling into the
    // Mantissa. The spilling creates the linear interpolation, while
    // the exponent creates exact results whenever the argument is an integer.     
    union { 
      double d;
      uint32_t i[2];
    } conv;

    conv.i[1] = static_cast&lt;uint32_t&gt;(in);
    conv.i[0] = 0;

    return conv.d;
  }
```

If you do not understand a code, contact the original author. If he or
she has left the company ask the most competent person. After working
out a piece of code that was not obvious, remember to document it.

Finally, comment the non-obvious:
```
// Turns out sorting this list before processing it is faster due to branch prediction, so don't
// remove this without checking the profile:
std::sort(users.begin(), users.end(), UserSortPredicate());
for (const User&amp; user: users)
{
    if (true == user.ready)
    {
        // Do something...
        
    }   // if (user ready)
}   // iterate (users)
```

### Use of C++11
We use C++11, but currently consider C++17 to immature for usage.


### Namespaces and using namespaces
Never pollute the any namespace using `using namespace std;`. Using
namespaces can be useful in limited scopes, such as within a
funciton. Don't

```
namespace fetch {
using namespace std; // Pollutes all of the fetch namespace and causes
                     // problems for every one.

class MyFetchClass {
public:
  void Greet() {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  // ...
};

};
```

Do


```
namespace fetch {
namespace details {
  struct FecthImpl { /* ... */ };
  
  void HelperFunction(FecthImpl &amp; s) {
     /* ... */
  }  
};

class MyFetchClass {
public:
  void DoSomeThing() {
    // This improves readability
    using namespace details; 

    FetchImpl f;
    HelperFunction(f);
  }
  // ...
};

};
```


### Structs
We use structs for passive data and, in some cases, template meta
programming. Everything else is done by `classes`. An example of a
passive data structure could be a persons record

```
struct Person {
  std::string name;
  int age;
  // ...
};
```

### Classes

Always mark all constructors and assignment operators explicitly, even
those which are the implicitly. For instance,

```
class Transaction {
public:
  Transaction() = default;
  Transaction(Transaction const&amp;) = default;
  Transaction(Transaction &amp;&amp;) = deleted;

  ~Transaction() = default;

  Transaction operator(Transaction const&amp;) = default;
  Transaction operator(Transaction &amp;&amp;) = deleted;
}
```
In this way there will be no confusion about the intended behaviour of
the class. Likewise, for those default implementations that are not
needed, mark them as deleted.

If a class is not meant to be subclassed, mark it as `final`. The same
counts for final implimentations of virtual functions. For example

```
class Foo {
public:
  virtual ~Foo() { }
  virtual void Greet() = 0;
  virtual void Say(std::string const&amp;) = 0;   
};

class Bar : public Foo {
public:
  void Greet() override final {
    // ...
  }
  
  void Say(std::string const&amp; what) override {
    // .. 
  };     
};

class Baz final : public Bar {
public:
  void Say(std::string const&amp; what) override {
    // ...
  } 
}; 

```

C++11 allows for inline initialization of your member variables. This
should be preferred at all times as uninitialized memory can have
secondary effects that makes almost impossible to debug a problem. When
it is not possible to use inline initialization, the member variables
should be initialized using the constructors initialization list where
they must be listed in the order they appear. Last resort, is
initialization inside the constructors body. This should only be used
when the the two previous are not applicable. In most cases, a
combination of the above will be used. As an example:

```
class MyClass {
public:
  MyClass() = default;
  
  MyClass(std::size_t n)
  : size_(n) {
    pointer_ = new int[n];
    for(std::size_t i=0; i&lt; n; ++i)
      pointer_[i] = 0;    
  }
  // ...
private:
  std::size_t size_ = 0;
  int* pointer_ = nullptr;
};
```
In this code, the inline initialization ensures that the default
constructor does not produce uninitialized memory. In the second
constructor, we manually need to initialize the `pointer_` but `size_`
can be set using the initialization list.

### Usage of `nullprt`
The new C++11 `nullptr` keyword designates an rvalue constant that
serves as a universal null pointer literal replacing the buggy and
weakly-typed literal 0 and the infamous `NULL` macro. `nullptr` thus
puts an end to more than 30 years of embarrassment, ambiguity, and bugs.  
Furhter, the new nullptr is type safe.</doc>
